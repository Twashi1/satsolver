# TODO: need some extended DIMACS format, ideally can hold multiple formulae in one file,
#   and store all satisfying truth assignments for testing
#       or at least whether or not the formula is satisfiable

# TODO: need to convert extended DIMACS format into a regular DIMACS so it can be fed to whatever sat solver
